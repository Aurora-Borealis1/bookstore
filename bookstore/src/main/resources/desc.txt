Design and Implement a Simple Online Bookstore System

Background: You are developing a backend system for a small online bookstore. This system needs to manage basic functionalities including book information, user accounts, and order processing.

Requirements:
1. Implement the following core functionalities:
    - Book management (add, query, update, delete)
    - User management (register, login, view personal information)
    - Order processing (create order, cancel order, check order status)

2. Use object-oriented design methodology
3. Implement RESTful API interfaces
4. Use either in-memory data storage or an actual database of your choice
5. Add appropriate exception handling and logging
6. Write unit tests covering core functionalities
7. Provide simple documentation explaining how to run and test your program

Technical Requirements:
1. Use any programming language

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Code quality and style (30%)
2. System design and architecture (30%)
3. Functionality completeness (20%)
4. Test coverage (15%)
5. Documentation quality (5%)

Bonus Points:
1. Implement basic authentication
2. Add caching mechanism to improve performance
3. Consider data consistency in concurrent scenarios
4. Containerize the application for easy deployment
5. Implement an A/B testing framework (particularly useful if implementing #6 the recommendation system)
6. AI-powered recommendation system
7. Intelligent search with natural language processing
8. Implement automated book categorization using a pre-trained text classification model
9. Design an anomaly detection system for identifying potential fraudulent orders

For AI-related features (items 6-9), you may choose one of the following approaches:
1. Use open-source machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Keras)
2. Utilize cloud AI services (e.g., Azure AI, AWS AI Services, Google Cloud AI)
3. Leverage open-source large language models (e.g., Llama, BERT, T5)
4. Integrate commercial LLM via APIs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)

If you choose to implement any of these features, please provide a brief explanation of your approach, including:
- Which method you chose (library, cloud service, or LLM)
- Why you selected this particular approach
- Any assumptions or limitations of your implementation
- A high-level description of how you integrated the AI functionality into the bookstore system

Please provide the source code, test cases, and documentation upon completion.

Happy coding!
